## Introduction
The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various algorithms in an interactive way. Users can select an algorithm and see how it works step-by-step, making it a valuable educational tool for students and anyone interested in learning algorithms.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of popular algorithms such as:
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Step-by-step execution with visual feedback.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.
- Easy navigation and algorithm selection.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the algorithm visualizations and interactivity.
- **PHP**: For backend logic and data handling (if applicable).
- **Optional**: Libraries such as jQuery or Chart.js for enhanced visualizations.
