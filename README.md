## Introduction
The Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based application that allows users to visualize various algorithms in an interactive way. Users can select an algorithm and see how it works step-by-step, making it a valuable educational tool for students and anyone interested in learning algorithms.

## Features
- Interactive visualization of popular algorithms such as:
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
  - Searching algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
- Step-by-step execution with visual feedback.
- User-friendly interface with responsive design.
- Easy navigation and algorithm selection.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the algorithm visualizations and interactivity.
- **PHP**: For backend logic and data handling (if applicable).
- **Optional**: Libraries such as jQuery or Chart.js for enhanced visualizations.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualizer.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**:
   ```bash
   cd algorithm-visualizer
3.**Set up a local server:**
- You can use tools like XAMPP or MAMP to run PHP applications locally.
- Place the project folder in the htdocs directory (for XAMPP) or the www directory (for MAMP).
4.**Access the application:**
  -Open your web browser and go to http://localhost/algorithm-visualizer to see the application in action.
## Usage
1. **Select an Algorithm**: Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.
2. **Input Data**: Depending on the algorithm, input the necessary data (e.g., an array of numbers).
3. **Start Visualization**: Click the "Visualize" button to begin the algorithm execution.
4. **Step Through Execution**: Use the "Next" button to step through each stage of the algorithm.
